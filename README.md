## Description
Hi! My name is Alex , and this is my first GitHub repo. Here I practice my skills at writing markdown texts, LaTeX formulas and other fun things like that.
## My favorite university subjects
Currently my favorite subjects are:
1. Mathematical analysis
2. Coding
3. Fundamentals of AI and DA
## Online VS Offline studying
| Online | Offline |
| :---: | :---: |
|You can sleep more comfortably during classes. More time to do tasks.|Communication with most of classmates. I have to go outside.|
## My favourite math formulas
**Heron's formula**

$$
S=\sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}; p=\frac{a+b+c}{2} 
$$

**Gauss's sum formula**

$$
S_n=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}
$$

**General form of a polynomial**

$$
a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0        
$$

## My coding skills
I know only 1 phrase:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

You can test my skills in a [**web-compiler**](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/). The `main()` function will print "Hello, World!"
